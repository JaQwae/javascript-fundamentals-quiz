# JavaScript Quiz


## Description

This project allows a user to take a short multiple choice quiz on the basics of JavaScript. It also comes with a fully functioning leaderboard that allows you to complete with other players.

## Features

I've included the features below using:

- Fully functioning navigational buttons that allow the user to skip to a certain point.

- A timed quiz that not only add points for every correct answer, but subtracts time for every incorrect answer.

- A leaderboard that allows the user to input their initials and be displayed along side other users that have taken the test.

  

What's to come:

- Increasing the number of question in quiz 
- Randomize the order of question each time the quiz is taken
- Potentially condense quiz into one html element
